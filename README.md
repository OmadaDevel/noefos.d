# Noefos

Noefos Daemon is a full-featured C++ for Noefos P2P Network based off of I2P.

I2P (Invisible Internet Protocol) is a universal anonymous network layer.  
All communications over I2P are anonymous and end-to-end encrypted, participants
don't reveal their real IP addresses, and was chosen as a base of our network for this reason.

Noefos daemon is a software used for building and using the Noefos
subnetwork. I2P is commonly used for anonymous peer-to-peer
applications (filesharing, cryptocurrencies) and anonymous client-server
applications (websites, instant messengers, chat-servers).  

This protocol allows people from all around the world to communicate and share information
without restrictions.  

# Features
